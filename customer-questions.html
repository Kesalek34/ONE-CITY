           lost R17bn in revenue.</li>
     <li>The City of Tshwane needs to have a way to provide its citizens with an opportunity to pay for their historic debts without using money because
       many citizens struggle with paying their debts.</li>
  
       <li> The city needs to have enough resources (e.g. Human resources and Capital resources) to provide 
          quality service delivery without worrying about budget constraints.</li>
  
      <li>The City of Tshwane needs to identify services from its services catalog where its customers can come and provide such services to have their historic debts reduced.</li>
  <li>Citizens of the City of Tshwane need to pay back what they owe to the city.</li>
  <li>Citizens of the City of Tshwane need to interact with the city in terms of reporting issues in their areas, track and follow up on those reports on the platform, allow other members of the area to view those reported issues and collectively work together with the city to provide solutions to those problems.</li>
  <li>Citizens of the City of Tshwane need to be provided with a way where they can approach the city and request to service the city whenever they see a need for that service within the city and they have the right skills and capacity to provide that service.</li>

  <ol>
  <li>The City of Tshwane is developing its annual service delivery plan for the new financial year. The city wants to reduce costs associated with hiring contractors for various tasks, such as repairs or maintenance. The City of Tshwane identifies all the services they want to reduce contractor costs on and uses the 1City system to generate and drive service delivery campaigns to allow people to come and provide
       those services in exchange for reducing their historic debts.</li>
  <li>Michael is a handyman who needs to pay his property rates and tax bill but is short on cash. He offers to provide a day's worth of handyman services to the city in exchange for the tax payment. 
      The city accepts his offer and assigns him to repair a broken fence at a local park. Michael completes the work, and the city uses the 1City system to verify the work done before processing his property rates and tax payment.</li>
  <li> A company that deals with plumbing and sewer systems around the city is having a bad business season and is unable to pay for its rates and taxes. The company owner uses 5th Street when driving to work every morning and notices that there are a couple of blocked sewer pipelines on that street. The company owner approaches the City of Tshwane and asks to unblock all the blocked sewer pipelines on
       5th Street in exchange for a settlement of the company’s taxes.</li>
  <li> Paul is staying in an RDP house provided by the city next to a primary school and has been unable to pay for his Tshwane Service bills for some years now. He usually picks up piece jobs around the community to trim people’s trees and gardens. Paul has always wanted to make payment arrangements with the City of Tshwane to pay for his historic debt, but his economic circumstances have always prevented him to commit to paying a certain amount every month. Paul can take care of the grass and trees around the schoolyard and decides to approach the city to offer his services every month until his historic debt is paid out. The City of Tshwane accepts his request and allows Paul to do this work and uses the 1City system to verify
       the work done before processing his debt reductions every month.</li>

      <h2  class="text-success">What is the customer problem or opportunity?</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>Today the City of Tshwane does not have an interactive way for citizens who have service delivery issues to report issues around their area with ease, where they can track reported issues, and allow other citizens within the same area to view the reported issues to avoid having a backlog of the report of the same issue by multiple people 
          staying in the same area, so having a  platform that allows that will be useful.</li>

      <li>Today the City of Tshwane have to rely on revenue collection strategies
           that require its customers to pay using cash only when paying for their current and historic service debts.</li>
      
      <li>Today the City of Tshwane has to rely only on the funds provided by the Treasury as part of its annual budget when planning for its overall annual service delivery in the city which thus affects the city's service
           delivery capacity and the successful accomplishment of its set objectives.</li>
      <li>Today the citizens of the City of Tshwane need to report service delivery issues
           in person or by email when they need the service. </li>
          
      <li>Today the citizens of the City of Tshwane see issues in their areas but it is not easy to make the City of Tshwane aware because their offices are far from where they live when there is a platform that will allow them to interact with the city to report issues in their areas, track and follow up on those reports on the platform, allows other citizens of the area to view those reported issues
           and collectively work together with the city to provide solutions to those problems.</li>

  <h2  class="text-success">What are the most important customer benefits?</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>By implementing the Service-for-Service system, the City of Tshwane will 
          get their lost revenue back because this is the implementation of alternative ways of payment which result in resolving customer debts</li>
      <li>The City of Tshwane will benefit from the increased service delivery capacity to service its people that comes with the Service-for-Service system. The current capacity will be increased by the requests
           from the city's customers to service the city at little or zero cost attached.</li>
      <li> The City of Tshwane will benefit from the positive cash flow that the Service-for-Service system brings. The reality is that there is always a cost attached to every service that the city delivers to its customers, the Service-for-Service system will help the city provide
           some of its service delivery to its customers for little to zero cost required.</li>
      <li>The City of Tshwane will benefit by taking advantage of the skills and time its customers want to trade to drive service delivery campaigns.
           This will position the city to achieve its set service delivery objectives.</li>
      <li>The City of Tshwane will benefit by having a centralized platform that provides its customers with an ability to connect,
           interact with and promote collaboration between the city and its citizens to work together to provide solutions to problems, this will result in reported issues being attended to on time.</li>
      <li>The City of Tshwane's customers will benefit from having a platform where they have the option to pay for their debts and where they use their skills and time to service the city. 
          This may have an indirect impact on the city's service delivery objectives.</li>
      <li>The City of Tshwane will benefit from its customers which will also encourage these customers to have a sense of responsibility 
          in their respective areas to report illegal activities that are costing the city.</li>

               to the city's overall service delivery objectives at little or zero cost attached.</p>
